Known Bugs
-> [Firefox] Minimap does not update when chaging sizes
  -> Media Queries and animations don't play nice with Firefox
-> Loading images can still take time on slow networks

Ideas
-> Set angle before moving position (delay the setPosition call)
-> Pressing Automatic Camera should move POV to supposed current POV
